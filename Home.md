# Introduction
This **Sandbox** Wiki is a place for me to play with GitHub Wiki (or this copy of the Wiki's `.md` files). I find it to be an odd beast. I've opted to limit my experimentation to markdown (`.md`) files. You may have different results using other supported file formats. 
  - :+1: My interest is in determining what is involved in migrating select pages and their artifacts (mostly images) from an **Azure DevOps Wiki** to GitHub Wiki.

Unless you do something out of the ordinary to change it, the Wiki has no hierarchy. It's just a flat pool of content (files) in an underlying git repository. That doesn't bother me. It's in keeping with [Wiki's Unified Design Principle](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiDesignPrinciples).

## Reference

## Notes
1. Azure DevOps Wiki stores all images in a singular, top-level `.attachments` folder. I was able to do the same here.
1. In GitHub Wiki the final pound sign (\#) preceding a heading or subheading must be followed by a space. I am not in the habit of doing this in Azure DevOps Wiki. That will have to be converted.

# Editing Wiki Content

# Custom Navigation or Page Aggregation
The flat `Pages` widget listing **EVERY page** bothers me. For all but a simple Wiki this seems problematic. [Supported MediaWiki formats](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/editing-wiki-content#supported-mediawiki-formats) ([Editing wiki content](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/editing-wiki-content)) offers too little guidance. 

So, I have tried or am trying these experiments: 
   1. [[Sidebar(s)]]. Sadly I've been unable to make the work (reliably).
