# Concepts
Slack uses a number of particular terms for aspects of its ecosystem that you will encounter in using Slack. Here are the most notable:

## Conversation
- Slack is effectively a collection of “chat rooms,” each of which is either a [channel](#channel) or a set of direct messages between two or more people. Collectively, these are conversations.

## Member
- Someone with a registered account that’s part of a Slack [workspace](#workspace).

## Workspace
- A set of Slack [conversations](#conversation) and [members](#member) is a workspace. Some large companies have many workspaces linked together via a high-end, paid Slack service tier. Most Slack setups consist of a single [workspace](#workspace) as part of a “Slack for Teams” tier.

## Channel 
- A Channel is a persistent, dedicated, [conversation space](#conversation) (chat room).

### Single-channel Guest
- A member whose access is limited to a single channel (applicable only to paid plans).

### Multi-channel Guest
- A member whose access is limited to a selected set of [channels](#channel) (applicable only to paid plans).

## @mention
- Slack lets you tag other people using a [display name](#display-name) or their full name so that they can opt to be notified about you referring to them.

## Display Name
- A different way for people to @mention you in Slack than your full name. If this option is left empty at signup and never changed, then when people @mention you, Slack relies on your full name. The display name also appears in your profile.
