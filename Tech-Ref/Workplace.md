# Introduction
"***Workplace:*** _Slalomâ€™s facebook for work. Build out your profile and stay connected to your colleagues in the market._"

_Workplace is a tool that connects everyone in your company, even if they're working remotely. Use familiar features such as Groups, Chat, Rooms and live video broadcasting to get people talking and working together._

   - :bulb: Slalom IT manages an instance of Workplace by Facebook that is in a closed pilot state with our California offices.  Access is currently limited to members of those markets. If you are a member of a California office, please remember to use Teams with Slalom colleagues outside your market. -- [How We Work (HWW): Chat](https://twodegrees1.sharepoint.com/teams/HWW/SitePages/IM%26Chat.aspx)
