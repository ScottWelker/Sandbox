# Introduction
|:warning: Warning!|
|:-|
| **[SWelker](/Individuals/Scott-Welker):** Some equate ***Confluence*** with [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki) and may even assert it is a [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki). However, in its current form, it is not truly a [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki). It no longer adheres to many fundamental [Wiki Design Principles](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiDesignPrinciples), e.g. **simple**, **mundane**, **universal**, **unified**, **precise**, and **convergent**. Additionally its content is siloed in a proprietary format leaving it difficult to migrate an unsuitable for leveraging common tools facilitating bulk content generation and loading. |

"_***Confluence*** is a web-based corporate collaboration software developed by Australian software company [Atlassian](/Tech-Ref/Atlassian)._"

## Notes
1. :warning: This product has a [long-standing problem with its search, here #14910](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-14910).
   - From [my (SWelker)](/Individuals/Scott-Welker) prior first-hand experience, many Confluence users refused to continue using Confluence because they didnâ€™t trust its search results. Some users wrongly believed they lost content because they were unable to find it via the search feature.
1. This product once was rightly considered to be a [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki) but has drifted too far away from [Wiki Design Principles](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiDesignPrinciples). It is no longer _really_ a [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki).
