# Introduction
"_The ***Macintosh*** (***Mac***) is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984._"

"_The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market all-in-one desktop personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II, Apple IIGS, Apple III, and Apple Lisa families of computers until the other models were discontinued in the 1990s._"
