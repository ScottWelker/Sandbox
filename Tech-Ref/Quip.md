# Introduction
|:warning: Warning!|
|:-|
|**[SWelker](/Individuals/Scott-Welker):** Some equate ***Quip*** with [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki) and may even assert it is a [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki). On cursory review of its documentation that seems to be incorrect. It **IS** "_collaborative productivity software_", seemingly not unlike [Confluence](/Tech-Ref/Atlassian/Confluence). However, in their current form, neither offering is truly a [Wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki). They each fail to adhere to too many fundamental [Wiki Design Principles](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiDesignPrinciples)|
| See [Using Markdown (Tips and Tricks)](#using-markdown). |

"_***Quip*** is a collaborative productivity software suite for mobile and the Web. It allows groups of people to create and edit documents and spreadsheets as a group, typically for business purposes._"

Various diagramming add-on are available, e.g. [diagrams.net](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Modeling/diagrams.net) and [LucidChart](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Modeling/LucidChart). You'll need to use whichever is installed in your Quip instance.
