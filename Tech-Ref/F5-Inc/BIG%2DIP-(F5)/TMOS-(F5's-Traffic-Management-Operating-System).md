# Introduction
"_[F5’s](/Tech-Ref/F5-Inc/F5-TMOS) ***Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS)*** is, first and foremost and for the sake of clarity, NOT an individual [operating system](/Tech-Ref/OS-\(Operating-System\)). It is the software foundation for all of [F5’s](/Tech-Ref/F5-Inc/F5-TMOS) network or traffic (not data) products; physical or virtual. TMOS almost seems to be a concept rather than a concrete thing when you first try to understand it. [I’ve](https://packetpushers.net/what-the-heck-is-f5-networks-tmos) struggled to find a truly definitive definition of TMOS in any manual or on any website._"

"_So, what is TMOS? It’s not too tough after all, really; TMOS encompasses a collection of operating systems and firmware, all of which run on BIG-IP hardware appliances or within the BIG-IP Virtual Edition. BIG-IP and TMOS (and even TMM) are often used interchangeably where features, system and feature modules are concerned. This can be confusing; for instance, although LTM is a TMOS system module running within TMM, it’s commonly referred to as BIG-IP LTM. I suspect we have the F5 marketing team to thank for this muddled state of affairs. See the comments section for some clarification from F5 but some debate too._"
