# Introduction
"_***Containers*** are a form of [operating system](/Tech-Ref/OS-\(Operating-System\)) virtualization A single container might be used to run anything from a small [microservice](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Distributed-Computing/Microservices) or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files. Compared to server or machine virtualization approaches, however, containers do not contain [operating system](/Tech-Ref/OS-\(Operating-System\)) images. This makes them more lightweight and portable, with significantly less overhead. In larger application deployments, multiple containers may be deployed as one or more container clusters. Such clusters might be managed by a container orchestrator such as [Kubernetes](/Tech-Ref/Virtualization/Containers-\(OS-Virtualization\)/Kubernetes)._"

> According to Docker (the most popular containers platform), a container is a stand-alone, lightweight package that has everything needed to execute a piece of software. It packs your code, runtime environment, systems tools, libraries, binaries, and settings. ... It runs the same everytime regardless of where you run it. It adds a layer of isolation, helping reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure.

## Notes
1. Users involved in container environments are likely to hear about two popular tools and [platforms](/Tech-Ref/Virtualization/Containers-\(OS-Virtualization\)/Container-Platform) used to build and manage containers. These are [Docker](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Docker) and [Kubernetes](/Tech-Ref/Virtualization/Containers-\(OS-Virtualization\)/Kubernetes).
