# Introduction
"_**Go** is a statically typed, compiled [programming language](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development#languages) designed at [Google](/Tech-Ref/Google). It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as **Golang** because of its former domain name, `golang.org`, but its proper name is Go._"

"_There are two major implementations:_"
- "_[Google's](/Tech-Ref/Google) self-hosting `gc` compiler toolchain, targeting multiple [operating systems](/Tech-Ref/OS-\(Operating-System\)) and [WebAssembly](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Wasm-\(WebAssembly\))._"
- "_gofrontend, a frontend to other compilers, with the libgo library. With [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) the combination is `gccgo`; with [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) the combination is `gollvm`._"

"_A third-party source-to-source compiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) for front-end web development._"
