| Not to be confused with [Load Balancing](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Load-Balancing) in general. |

"_***Network Load Balancing (NLP),*** commonly referred to as dual-WAN routing or multihoming,  is the ability to balance traffic across two or more WAN links without using complex routing protocols like BGP._"

"_This capability balances network sessions like Web, email, etc. over multiple connections in order to spread out the amount of bandwidth used by each LAN user, thus increasing the total amount of bandwidth available._"
