# Introduction
"_***Virtual Private Network (VPN)*** describes any technology that can encapsulate and transmit network data, typically Internet Protocol data, over another network. Such a system enables users to access network resources that may otherwise be inaccessible from the public internet. VPNs are frequently used in the information technology sector to provide access to resources for users that are not physically connected to an organization's network, such as telecommuting workers. VPNs are so named because they may be used to provide virtual (as opposed to physical) access to a private network._"
