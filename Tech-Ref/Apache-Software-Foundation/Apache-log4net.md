# Introduction
"_The ***Apache log4net*** library is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets. log4net is a port of the excellent Apache log4j™ framework to the [Microsoft® .NET runtime](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework). We have kept the framework similar in spirit to the original log4j while taking advantage of new features in the [.NET runtime](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework). For more information on log4net see the features document._"
