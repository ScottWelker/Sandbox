# Introduction
"_The ***Apache Ant*** is a software tool for automating software build processes which originated from the [Apache Tomcat](/Tech-Ref/Apache-Software-Foundation/Apache-Tomcat) project in early 2000 as a replacement for the Make build tool of [Unix](/Tech-Ref/Unix). It is similar to Make, but is implemented using the [Java language](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) and requires the [Java platform](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions). Unlike Make, which uses the Makefile format, Ant uses [XML](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language/XML-\(eXtensible-Markup-Language\)) to describe the code build process and its dependencies._"
