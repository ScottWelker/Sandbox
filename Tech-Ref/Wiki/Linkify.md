# Introduction
***Linkify***, a [Wiki Gardening](/Tech-Ref/Wiki/Wiki-Gardening) and authoring activity, refers to converting a bit of plain text to a hyperlink. The following excerpt covers the topic well:

- "_Link link link. New contributors don't cross-link. They're not usually averse to it; they just don't think to do it. Encourage them to "linkify" any term (yes, I mean any term) in their entries that is either proprietary vocabulary, potentially unclear to some readers, or describes a strategic concept where the company might have proprietary insights. These three criteria cover a pretty broad range of terms, and in even a short (e.g., 1-2 paragraph) entry, you can probably find at least a half-dozen terms that should be links...even if the underlying pages don't exist yet._" --[Ross Mayfield's Weblog, Social Software's Culture Clash, "Link, Link, Link"](https://ross.typepad.com/blog/socialtext/page/2#entry-46256654)
