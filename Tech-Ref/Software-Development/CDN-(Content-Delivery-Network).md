# Introduction
"_A ***Content Delivery Network (CDN),*** or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed [network](/Tech-Ref/Networking) of [proxy servers](/Tech-Ref/Networking/Proxy-Server) and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet as the Internet was starting to become a mission-critical medium for people and enterprises. Since then, CDNs have grown to serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social media sites._"
