# Introduction
"_While you can write your [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) programs in a simple text editor, a ***Java IDE*** with helpful tools will drastically increase your efficiency. An [IDE](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/IDE-\(Integrated-Development-Environment\)) will include a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger to make [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) programming easier. But with so many options on the market, it can be hard to determine which IDE is best for you._" --[Educative: Best Java IDEs 2021](https://www.educative.io/blog/best-java-ides-2021)
