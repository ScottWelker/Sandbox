# Introduction
"_***Java Platform Editions*** The [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the Java programming language. A [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) platform includes an execution engine (called a [virtual machine](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)/JVM-\(Java-Virtual-Machine\))), a compiler and a set of libraries; there may also be additional servers and alternative libraries that depend on the requirements. [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) platforms have been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems with a view to enable [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) programs to run identically on all of them. Different platforms target different classes of device and application domains._"
