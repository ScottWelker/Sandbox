# Introduction
|:skull: Deprecated!|
|:-|
| "_Beginning in 2013, major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology applets used to run, with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015â€“2017. Java applets were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017._" --https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet |

"_***Java Applet*** were small applications written in the [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) programming language, or another programming language that compiles to [Java bytecode](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)/JVM-\(Java-Virtual-Machine\)/Java-Bytecode), and delivered to users in the form of [Java bytecode](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)/JVM-\(Java-Virtual-Machine\)/Java-Bytecode). The user launched the [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) applet from a [web page](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Page), and the applet was then executed within a [Java virtual machine (JVM)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)/JVM-\(Java-Virtual-Machine\)) in a process separate from the web [browser](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Browser) itself. A [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) applet could appear in a frame of the [web page](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Page), a new application window, Sun's AppletViewer, or a stand-alone tool for testing applets._"
