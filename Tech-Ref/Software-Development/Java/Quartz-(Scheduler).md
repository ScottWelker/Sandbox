# Introduction
"_***Quartz*** is a richly featured, open source ***job scheduling library*** that can be integrated within virtually any [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) components that may execute virtually anything you may program them to do. The Quartz Scheduler includes many enterprise-class features, such as support for JTA transactions and clustering._"
