# Introduction
"_In computing based on the [Java Platform](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java), ***JavaBeans*** are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). They are **serializable**, have a **zero-argument constructor**, and allow **access to properties using getter and setter** methods. The name "Bean" was given to encompass this standard, which aims to create reusable software components for Java._"
