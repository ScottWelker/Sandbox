# Introduction
"_The ***Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)*** is a [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) API for a directory service that allows [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) software clients to discover and look up data and resources (in the form of [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) objects) via a name. Like all [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) APIs that interface with [host](/Tech-Ref/Networking/Host) systems, JNDI is independent of the underlying implementation. Additionally, it specifies a service provider interface (SPI) that allows directory service implementations to be plugged into the framework._"
