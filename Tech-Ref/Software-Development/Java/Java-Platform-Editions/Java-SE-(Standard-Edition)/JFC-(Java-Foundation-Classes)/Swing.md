# Introduction
"_***Swing*** is a GUI widget toolkit for [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java). It is part of [Oracle's](/Tech-Ref/Oracle-Corporation) [Java Foundation Classes (JFC)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JFC-\(Java-Foundation-Classes\)) â€“ an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs._"

"_Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier [Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JFC-\(Java-Foundation-Classes\)/AWT-\(Abstract-Window-Toolkit\)). Swing provides a look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms, and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform. It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. In addition to familiar components such as buttons, check boxes and labels, Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists._"

"_Unlike [AWT](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JFC-\(Java-Foundation-Classes\)/AWT-\(Abstract-Window-Toolkit\)) components, Swing components are not implemented by platform-specific code. Instead, they are written entirely in [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) and therefore are platform-independent._"
