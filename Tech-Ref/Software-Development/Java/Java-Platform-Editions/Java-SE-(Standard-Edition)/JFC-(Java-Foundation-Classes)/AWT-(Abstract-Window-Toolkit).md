# Introduction
"_The ***Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)*** is [Java's](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) original platform-dependent windowing, graphics, and user-interface widget toolkit, preceding [Swing](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JFC-\(Java-Foundation-Classes\)/Swing). The AWT is part of the [Java Foundation Classes (JFC)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JFC-\(Java-Foundation-Classes\)) â€” the standard API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) program. AWT is also the GUI toolkit for a number of [Java ME](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-ME-\(Micro-Edition\)) profiles. For example, Connected Device Configuration profiles require [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) runtimes on mobile telephones to support the Abstract Window Toolkit._"
