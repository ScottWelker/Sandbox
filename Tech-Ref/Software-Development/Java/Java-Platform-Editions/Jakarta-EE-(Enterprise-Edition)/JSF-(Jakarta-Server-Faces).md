# Introduction
|:mask: Aged.|
|:-|
| Some view this as an aged technology that is on-the-wain. Others argue it simply should not be used for technical reasons, e.g [DZone: Why You Should Avoid JSF](https://dzone.com/articles/why-you-should-avoid-jsf)<ul><li>Don't fail to notice [Ed Burns, JSF Steward's rebuttal (in the comments)](https://dzone.com/articles/why-you-should-avoid-jsf).</li></ul> |
| Consider Spring or Spring Boot instead. |

"_***Jakarta Server Faces*** is a [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) specification for building component-based [user interfaces](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/UX-\(User-Experience\)/GUI-\(Graphical-User-Interface\)) for [web applications](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Application) and was formalized as a standard through the Java Community Process being part of the [Java Platform, Enterprise Edition](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)). It is also a [MVC](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Software-Design-Pattern/MVC-\(Model-View-Controller\)) web framework that simplifies construction of [user interfaces (UI)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/UX-\(User-Experience\)/GUI-\(Graphical-User-Interface\)) for server-based applications by using reusable [UI](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/UX-\(User-Experience\)/GUI-\(Graphical-User-Interface\)) components in a [page](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Page)._"

"_JSF 2 uses Facelets as its default templating system. Other view technologies such as XUL or plain [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) can also be employed. In contrast, JSF 1.x uses [JavaServer Pages (JSP)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)/JSP-\(Jakarta-Server-Pages\)) as its default templating system._"
