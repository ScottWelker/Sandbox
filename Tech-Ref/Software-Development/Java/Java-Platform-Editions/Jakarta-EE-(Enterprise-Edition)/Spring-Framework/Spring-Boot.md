# Introduction
|:+1: Important!|
|:-|
|Various [Spring](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)/Spring-Framework) and Spring Boot references focus on a particular kind-of solution for which Spring Boot is applicable. This can give you the wrong impression that Spring Boot is limited to just that particular kind-of application. <mark>As noted on the [Why Spring page](https://spring.io/why-spring) "_Springâ€™s flexible and comprehensive set of extensions and third-party libraries let developers build almost any application imaginable._" This extends to [Spring Boot](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)/Spring-Framework/Spring-Boot) as well.</mark>|

"_***Spring Boot*** is [Spring's](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)/Spring-Framework) convention-over-configuration solution for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run". It is preconfigured with the Spring team's "opinionated view" of the best configuration and use of the [Spring platform](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)/Spring-Framework) and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little [Spring](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)/Spring-Framework) configuration._"
