# Introduction
"_***Spring Boot Annotations*** (AKA Decorations or Tags) "_...is a form of metadata that provides data about a program. In other words, annotations are used to provide supplemental information about a program. It is not a part of the application that we develop. It does not have a direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate. It does not change the action of the compiled program._"
