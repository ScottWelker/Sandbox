# Introduction
"_***Jakarta Messaging*** formerly ***Java Message Service (JMS)*** is a [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) application programming interface (API) for message-oriented middleware. It provides generic messaging models, able to handle the producerâ€“consumer problem, that can be used to facilitate the sending and receiving of messages between software systems. Jakarta Messaging is a part of [Jakarta EE](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)) and was originally defined by a specification developed at Sun Microsystems before being guided by the [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) Community Process._"
