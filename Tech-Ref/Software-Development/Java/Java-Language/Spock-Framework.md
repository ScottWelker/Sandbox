# Introduction
"_***Spock Framework*** is a testing and specification framework for [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) and Groovy applications. What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and highly expressive specification language. Thanks to its [JUnit](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Language/JUnit-Unit%2DTesting-Framework) runner, Spock is compatible with most [IDEs](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/IDE-\(Integrated-Development-Environment\)), [build tools](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Build-Automation), and [continuous integration](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Build-Automation) servers. Spock is inspired from [JUnit](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Language/JUnit-Unit%2DTesting-Framework), jMock, RSpec, Groovy, Scala, Vulcans, and other fascinating life forms._"
