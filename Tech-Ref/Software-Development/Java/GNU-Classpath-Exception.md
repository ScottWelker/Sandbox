# Introduction
"_***GNU Classpath Exception*** exception permits linking a GPL library with an independent module (“which is not derived from or based on the library“), without subjecting the resulting program to the GPL. The independent module can obviously be your own proprietary program. Therefore, the classpath exception enables to use GPL’ed license components in a certain way without risking the integrity of your Intellectual Property._"

"_The GNU GPL requires that every work based on the program – that is, every derivative of the original program or any modifications one introduces to it – be subject to the GPL. As such, it may cover your original code if you combined it with a GPL module._"
