# Introduction
|:point_right: Note!|
|:-|
| ***JAR*** may refer to the [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) package file, the package file format, or to the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JDK-\(Java-Development-Kit\)), ['jar.exe' tool](#jar.exe) with which such files can be manipulated.<br/><br/>This page may seamlessly drift across some or all of these subjects. |

"_***Java ARchive (JAR)*** is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution._"

"_A JAR file allows Java runtimes to efficiently deploy an entire application, including its classes and their associated resources, in a single request._"

"_**JAR** files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file. They are built on the ZIP format and typically have a `.jar` file extension._"
