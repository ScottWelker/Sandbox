# Introduction
"_***Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)*** is the combined practices of continuous integration and either continuous delivery or continuous deployment._"

"_CI/CD is a process and a methodology designed to make sure that all the code you merge to main is deployable at any time by testing it and deploying it. Automatically. After every diff._"

"_If any engineer on your team can merge a set of changes to main, secure in the knowledge that 15 minutes later their changes will have been tested and deployed to production, with no human gates or manual intervention required, then congratulations! Youâ€™re doing CI/CD._"
