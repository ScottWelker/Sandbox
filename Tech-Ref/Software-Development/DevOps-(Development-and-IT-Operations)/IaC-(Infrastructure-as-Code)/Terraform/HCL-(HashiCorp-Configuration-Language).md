# Introduction
"_The ***HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)***  is a unique configuration language. It was designed to be used with HashiCorp tools, notably [Terraform](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/IaC-\(Infrastructure-as-Code\)/Terraform), but HCL has expanded as a more general configuration language. Itâ€™s visually similar to [JSON](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JSON-\(JavaScript-Object-Notation\)) with additional data structures and capabilities built-in._"
