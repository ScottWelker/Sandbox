# Introduction
"_***Quality of Service (QoS)*** is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or [computer network](/Tech-Ref/Networking) or a [cloud computing service](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Cloud-Computing), particularly the performance seen by the users of the [network](/Tech-Ref/Networking). To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the [network service](/Tech-Ref/Networking) are often considered, such as packet loss, bit rate, throughput, transmission delay, availability, jitter, etc._"
