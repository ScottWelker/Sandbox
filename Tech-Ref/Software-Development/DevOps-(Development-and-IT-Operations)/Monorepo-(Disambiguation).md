# Disambiguation
***Monorepo*** is a general term used in the context of version control systems. Often the term is intended to refer specifically to a given product or tool used in a specific endeavor, e.g. [Slalom's](/Slalom-LLC/Slalom-Consulting) work for [Cepheid](/Clients/Cepheid) uses [Lerna](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Monorepo-\(Disambiguation\)/Lerna) to manage its ***Monorepo***.

Generally, "_a ***monorepo*** ("mono" meaning 'single' and "repo" being short for 'repository') is a software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in the same repository. As of 2017, various forms of this software engineering practice were over two decades old, but the general concept had only recently been named. Many attempts have been made to differentiate between monolithic applications and other, newer forms of monorepos._"

"_Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb, and Twitter all employ very large monorepos with varying strategies to scale build systems and version control software with a large volume of code and daily changes._"
