# Introduction
"_***ELK Stack*** is the world’s most popular log management platform. In contrast, [Splunk](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/Splunk) — the historical leader in the space — self-reports 15,000 customers in total._"

"_ELK Stack was a collection of three open-source products — [Elasticsearch](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/ELK-Stack/Elasticsearch-\(ELK\)), [Logstash](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/ELK-Stack/Logstash-\(ELK\)), and [Kibana](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/ELK-Stack/Kibana) — all developed, managed and maintained by Elastic. The introduction and subsequent addition of [Beats](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/ELK-Stack/Beats-\(ELK\)) turned the stack into a four legged project._"
