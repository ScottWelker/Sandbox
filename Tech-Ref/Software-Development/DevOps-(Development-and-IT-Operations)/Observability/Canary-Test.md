# Introduction
***Canary Test(s/ing)*** is a monitoring pattern where a system or service is exercised and measured on a regular basis to determine if it is operating within acceptable parameters.

This is generally considered most useful when there is too little traffic to otherwise measure the system's health or when a down-stream dependency is found to be unreliable.
