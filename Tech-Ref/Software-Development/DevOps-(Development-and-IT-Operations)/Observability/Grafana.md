# Introduction
"_**Grafana** is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization [web application](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Application). It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources._"

"_As a visualization tool, Grafana is a popular component in monitoring stacks, often used in combination with [time series databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database) such as [InfluxDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfluxDB), [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(software)) and [Graphite](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/Graphite-\(software\)); monitoring platforms such as Sensu, [Icinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icinga), [Checkmk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_MK), [Zabbix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabbix), [Netdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netdata), and [PRTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRTG_Network_Monitor); [SIEMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) such as [Elasticsearch](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/ELK-Stack/Elasticsearch-\(ELK\)) and [Splunk](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/Splunk); and other data sources. The Grafana user interface was originally based on version 3 of [Kibana](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Observability/ELK-Stack/Kibana)._"
