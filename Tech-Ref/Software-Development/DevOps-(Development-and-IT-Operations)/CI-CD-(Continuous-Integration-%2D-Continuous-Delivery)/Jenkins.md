# Introduction
"_***Jenkins*** is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of [software development](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development) related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating [continuous integration](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/CI-CD-\(Continuous-Integration-%2D-Continuous-Delivery\)/CI-\(Continuous-Integration\)) and [continuous delivery](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/CI-CD-\(Continuous-Integration-%2D-Continuous-Delivery\)). It is a server-based system that runs in [servlet](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)/Jakarta-Servlet) containers such as [Apache Tomcat](/Tech-Ref/Apache-Software-Foundation/Apache-Tomcat). It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, [Git](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Git), Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase and RTC, and can execute [Apache Ant](/Tech-Ref/Apache-Software-Foundation/Apache-Ant), [Apache Maven](/Tech-Ref/Apache-Software-Foundation/Apache-Maven) and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and [Windows](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Microsoft-Windows) batch commands._"
