# Introduction
***GitHub Wiki*** refers to the per-repository, [Wiki Engine](/Tech-Ref/Wiki) available through [GitHub](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/GitHub).

"_Every [GitHub](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/GitHub) repository comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a [wiki](/Tech-Ref/Wiki). You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. A README file quickly tells what your project can do, while you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation. For more information, see "About READMEs."_"
