# Introduction
"_There is no standard definition of what an application delivery controller does or how it does it, but the techniques used to enhance performance commonly include [load balancing](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Load-Balancing), caching, compression, and offloading of SSL processing._" --[NGINX: What Is an Application Delivery Controller (ADC)?](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/application-delivery-controller/)

- :+1: Tips!
   - "_Client requests interact with the ADC, and the ADC, acting as a **[reverse proxy](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Load-Balancing/Reverse-Proxy),** interacts with application servers on the clientâ€™s behalf._"
   - "_ADCs have gained traction due to increased demand for legacy load balancing..._" -- [Citrix: What is an application delivery controller (ADC)?](https://www.citrix.com/solutions/app-delivery-and-security/what-is-application-delivery-controller.html)
