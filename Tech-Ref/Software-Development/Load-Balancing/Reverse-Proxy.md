# Introduction
"_In [computer networks](/Tech-Ref/Networking), a reverse proxy is the application that sits in front of back-end applications and forwards client (e.g. [browser](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Browser)) requests to those applications. Reverse proxies help increase scalability, performance, resilience and security. The resources returned to the client appear as if they originated from the reverse proxy itself._"
