# Introduction
"_***Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)***  is the general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source(s) or in a different context than the source(s). The ETL process became a popular concept in the 1970s and is often used in [data warehousing](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database/Data-Warehouse)._"
