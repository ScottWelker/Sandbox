# Introduction
"_In a [Database](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database), a ***View*** is the result set of a stored query on the data, which the database users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object. This pre-established query command is kept in the database dictionary. Unlike ordinary base tables in a [relational database](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database/Relational-Database), a view does not form part of the physical schema: as a result set, it is a virtual table computed or collated dynamically from data in the database when access to that view is requested. Changes applied to the data in a relevant underlying table are reflected in the data shown in subsequent invocations of the view._"
