# Introduction
"_***Operational Data Store (ODS)*** is used for operational reporting and as a source of data for the [Data Warehouse](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database/Data-Warehouse). It is a complementary element to a [Data Warehouse](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database/Data-Warehouse) in a decision support landscape, and is used for operational reporting, controls and decision making, as opposed to the [Data Warehouse](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database/Data-Warehouse), which is used for tactical and strategic decision support._"

"_An ODS is a database designed to integrate data from multiple sources for additional operations on the data, for reporting, controls and operational decision support. Unlike a production master data store, the data is not passed back to operational systems. It may be passed for further operations and to the [data warehouse](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database/Data-Warehouse) for reporting._"
