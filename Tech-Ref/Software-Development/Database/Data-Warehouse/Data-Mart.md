# Introduction
"_A ***Data Mart*** is a structure / access pattern specific to data warehouse environments, used to retrieve client-facing data. The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse and is usually oriented to a specific business line or team. Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department._" -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mart

"_A data mart is a subject-oriented database that is often a partitioned segment of an enterprise data warehouse. The subset of data held in a data mart typically aligns with a particular business unit like sales, finance, or marketing. Data marts accelerate business processes by allowing access to relevant information in a data warehouse or operational data store within days, as opposed to months or longer. Because a data mart only contains the data applicable to a certain business area, it is a cost-effective way to gain actionable insights quickly._" -- https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-mart/
