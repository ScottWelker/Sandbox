# Introduction
"_***Python*** is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects._"

The core philosophies are summarized—in Pythonic fashion—in “[The Zen Of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python).” These include:

   - [Readability](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/) counts.
   - Simple is better than complex.
   - There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
