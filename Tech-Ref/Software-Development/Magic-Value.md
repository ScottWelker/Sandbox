# Introduction
A ***Magic Value*** is a literal value that appears in a program. Typically, '_magic values_' should be replaced with named constants, facilitating uniformity, ease of maintenance, and compiler checking, in the event of a type-Os.

"_A _Magic Value_ is a string or number used in a program that is essential to its proper function but provides no context or explanation for why it is what it is._" -- [KyleShevlin: What are “Magic Values”?](https://kyleshevlin.com/what-are-magic-values)
