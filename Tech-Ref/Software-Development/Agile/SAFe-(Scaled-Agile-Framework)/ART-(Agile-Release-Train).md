# Introduction
"_***Agile Release Train (ART)*** is a long lived, self-organizing team of [Agile](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile) Teams, a virtual organization (5 to 12 teams) that plans, commits, and executes together. ARTs are organized around the enterpriseâ€™s significant Value Streams and live solely to realize the promise of that value by building solutions that deliver benefit to the end user._"

"_Hence, an ART is basically a team of Teams responsible for the regular release of Features and business benefits. All the teams of an ART are bound by a common Vision, Program Backlog, and a Roadmap._" -- [digite: What is an ART?](https://www.digite.com/nao-categorizado/agile-release-train-art/)
