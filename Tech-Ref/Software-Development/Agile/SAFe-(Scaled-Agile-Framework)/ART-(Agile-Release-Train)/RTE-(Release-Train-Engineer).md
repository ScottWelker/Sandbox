# Introduction
"_The ***Release Train Engineer (RTE)*** has primary purpose of supporting and coaching an [Agile Release Train (ART)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/SAFe-\(Scaled-Agile-Framework\)/ART-\(Agile-Release-Train\)) by steering it to success and navigating the complexity of delivering software in large, cross-functional environments. The RTE helps resolve and escalate impediments, manages risk, helps assure value delivery, and drives program level continuous improvement. The RTE is accountable for the overall planning, coordination, execution, and delivery of value through the program._"
