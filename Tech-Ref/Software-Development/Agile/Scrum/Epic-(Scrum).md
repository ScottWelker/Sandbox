# Introduction
"_***Epic*** refers to large [stories](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\)) or multiple [user stories](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\)) that are closely related. A common explanation of epics is also: a [user story](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\)) that is too big for a [sprint](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/Sprint-\(Scrum\))._"
