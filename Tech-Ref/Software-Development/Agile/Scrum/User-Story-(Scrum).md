# Introduction
"_***User Story*** is an informal, natural language description of features of a [software system](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development). They are written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by different stakeholders like client, user, manager, or development team._"

"_User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; and may help software teams document their understanding of the system and its context._"

- :+1: Although not limited to [Agile](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile) / [Scrum](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum), _User Stories_ are typically encountered in that context [here at Slalom](/Slalom-LLC/Slalom-Consulting).
