# Introduction
Some [software development](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development) methodologies envision ***daily team meetings*** to make commitments to team members. The daily commitments allow participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult or time-consuming issues. The stand-up has particular value in [agile software development processes](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile), such as [scrum](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum) or [Kanban](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Kanban-\(Agile\)), but can be utilized in context of any software-development methodology.
