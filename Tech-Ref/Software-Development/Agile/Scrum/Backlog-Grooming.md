# Introduction
***Backlog Grooming***, increasingly termed ***Backlog Refinement***,  "_is when the [product owner](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/Product-Owner-\(Scrum\)) and some, or all, of the rest of the team review items on the [Product Backlog](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/Product-Backlog) to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery. This activity occurs on a regular basis and may be an officially scheduled meeting or an ongoing activity. Some of the activities that occur during this refinement of the backlog include:_"
   - _removing [user stories](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\)) that no longer appear relevant_
   - _creating new [user stories](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\)) in response to newly discovered needs_
   - _re-assessing the relative priority of [stories](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\))_
   - _assigning estimates to [stories](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\)) which have yet to receive one_
   - _correcting estimates in light of newly discovered information_
   - _splitting [user stories](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Agile/Scrum/User-Story-\(Scrum\)) which are high priority but too coarse grained to fit in an upcoming iteration_
