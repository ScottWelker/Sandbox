# Introduction
"_In [distributed computing](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Distributed-Computing), an ***Object Request Broker (ORB)*** is a middleware which allows program calls to be made from one computer to another via a computer network, providing location transparency through [remote procedure calls](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Distributed-Computing/RPC-\(Remote-Procedure-Call\)). ORBs promote interoperability of distributed object systems, enabling such systems to be built by piecing together objects from different vendors, while different parts communicate with each other via the ORB._"
