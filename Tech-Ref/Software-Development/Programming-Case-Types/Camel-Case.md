# Introduction
***Camel Case*** is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case. 

Camel case is often used as a naming convention in computer programming, but is an ambiguous definition due to the optional capitalization of the first letter. Some programming styles prefer camel case with the first letter capitalized, others not. For clarity, this article calls the two alternatives ***upper camel case*** (initial uppercase letter, also known as ***Pascal case*** or bumpy case) and ***lower camel case*** (initial lowercase letter, also known as dromedary case). Some people and organizations, notably Microsoft, use the term camel case only for lower camel case, designating Pascal case for the upper camel case.
