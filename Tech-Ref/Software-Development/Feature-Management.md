# Introduction
***Feature Management*** "_...is a technique in software development that attempts to provide an alternative to maintaining multiple branches in source code (known as feature branches), such that a software feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. A feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the feature during runtime. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for other users._"
