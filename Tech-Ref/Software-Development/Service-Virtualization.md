# Introduction
"_In software engineering, **Service Virtualization** is a method to emulate the behavior of specific components in heterogeneous component-based applications such as [API](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/API-\(Application-Programming-Interface\))-driven applications, [cloud](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Cloud-Computing)-based applications and [service-oriented architectures](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Distributed-Computing/SOA-\(Service-Oriented-Architecture\)). It is used to provide software development and QA/testing teams access to dependent system components that are needed to exercise an application under test, but are unavailable or difficult-to-access for development and testing purposes. With the behavior of the dependent components "virtualized", testing and development can proceed without accessing the actual live components._"
