# Introduction
"_***Reactive Programming (RP)*** is a programming paradigm that deals with asynchronous data streams (sequences of events) and the specific propagation of change, which means it implements modifications to the execution environment (context) in a certain order._"

"_Reactive Programming is Programming with Asynchronous Data Streams. In a way, this isn't anything new. Event buses or your typical click events are really an asynchronous event stream, on which you can observe and do some side effects. Reactive is that idea on steroids. You are able to create data streams of anything, not just from click and hover events. Streams are cheap and ubiquitous, anything can be a stream: variables, user inputs, properties, caches, data structures, etc. For example, imagine your Twitter feed would be a data stream in the same fashion that click events are. You can listen to that stream and react accordingly._" --[GitHub](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754#reactive-programming-is-programming-with-asynchronous-data-streams)
