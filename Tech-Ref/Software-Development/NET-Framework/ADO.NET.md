# Introduction
"_***ADO.NET*** is a data access technology from the [Microsoft .NET Framework](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework) that provides communication between [relational](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database) and non-relational systems through a common set of components._"

"_ADO.NET is a set of computer software components that programmers can use to access data and data services from a [database](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database). It is a part of the base class library that is included with the [Microsoft .NET Framework](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework). It is commonly used by programmers to access and modify data stored in [relational database systems](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database), though it can also access data in [non-relational data sources](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database). ADO.NET is sometimes considered an evolution of ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) technology, but was changed so extensively that it can be considered an entirely new product._"
