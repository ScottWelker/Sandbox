# Introduction
***Microsoft.Net.Http*** is a [package](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Microsoft-Windows/NuGet) that provides an "_HttpClient for sending requests over [HTTP](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/HTTP-\(Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol\)), as well as HttpRequestMessage and HttpResponseMessage for processing [HTTP](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/HTTP-\(Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol\)) messages._"

## Note
   - "_HttpClient started out as a [NuGet package](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Microsoft-Windows/NuGet) (out-of-band) and was added to the .NET Framework in 4.5 as well (in-box)._"
   - "_With .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 you shouldn't need to reference the SystemNetHttpClient NuGet package at all._"
   - "_If you target 4.5 and up, you should generally use the in-box version instead of this [NuGet](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Microsoft-Windows/NuGet) package._"
