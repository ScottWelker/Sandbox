# Introduction
"_***Autofac*** is an [IoC](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/IoC-\(Inversion-of-Control\)) container for [Microsoft .NET](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework). It manages the dependencies between classes so that applications stay easy to change as they grow in size and complexity. This is achieved by treating regular [.NET](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework) classes as components._"
