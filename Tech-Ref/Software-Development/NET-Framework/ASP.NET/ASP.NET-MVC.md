# Introduction
"_***ASP.NET MVC*** is a web application framework developed by [Microsoft](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft) that implements the [model–view–controller (MVC) pattern](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Software-Design-Pattern/MVC-\(Model-View-Controller\)). <mark>It is no longer in active development.</mark> It is open-source software, apart from the [ASP.NET Web Forms](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework/ASP.NET-Web-Forms) component, which is proprietary._"

"_<mark>[ASP.NET Core](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework/ASP.NET-Core) has since been released</mark>, which unified ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, [ASP.NET Web API](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework/ASP.NET/ASP.NET-Web-API), and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages). MVC 6 was abandoned due to Core and is not expected to be released. Core is currently planned to merge into .NET 5._"

"_Some well known sites that use ASP.NET MVC include Stack Overflow, Microsoft, GoDaddy and Ancestry.com._"
