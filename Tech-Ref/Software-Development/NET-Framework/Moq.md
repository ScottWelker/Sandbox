# Introduction
"_***Moq*** (pronounced "Mock") is a mocking library for [.NET](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework) developed from scratch to take full advantage of [.NET Linq](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/NET-Framework/LINQ-\(Language-Integrated-Query\)) expression trees and [lambda expressions](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Anonymous-Function), which makes it a productive, type-safe and refactoring-friendly mocking library. Moq supports mocking interfaces as well as classes. Its API is simple and straightforward, and doesn't require prior knowledge or experience with mocking concepts._"
