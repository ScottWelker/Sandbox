# Introduction
"_The ***OpenAPI Specification***, previously known as the [Swagger](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/REST-\(Representational-State-Transfer\)/Swagger) Specification, is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing [RESTful](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/REST-\(Representational-State-Transfer\)) [web services](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Service). Previously part of the [Swagger](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/REST-\(Representational-State-Transfer\)/Swagger) framework, it became a separate project in 2016, overseen by the OpenAPI Initiative, an open-source collaboration project of the [Linux](/Tech-Ref/Linux) Foundation. Swagger and some other tools can generate code, documentation and test cases given an interface file._"
