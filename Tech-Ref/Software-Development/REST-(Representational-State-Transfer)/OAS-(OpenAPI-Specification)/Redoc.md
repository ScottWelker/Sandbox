# Introduction
"_Redoc is an open-source tool that generates API documentation from [OpenAPI specifications](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/REST-\(Representational-State-Transfer\)/OAS-\(OpenAPI-Specification\))._" 

ReDoc proved that [OpenAPI](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/REST-\(Representational-State-Transfer\)/OAS-\(OpenAPI-Specification\))-powered documentation can be generated without vendor-specific extensions. It was generic enough to open-source.
