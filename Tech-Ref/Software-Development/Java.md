### Downloads
- :+1: See [Java Development Kits (JDKs)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JDK-\(Java-Development-Kit\)#java-development-kits). Most JDKs include a [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)) so there is usually no need to install one separately.

[I've (SWelker)](/Individuals/Scott-Welker) opted for the [free OpenJDK Build by Oracle](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JDK-\(Java-Development-Kit\)#openjdk-build-by-oracle-(free)) which includes the [Java SE (Standard Edition)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)) [JRE](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)). Still, [I've (SWelker)](/Individuals/Scott-Welker) included below a link to download the [Java SE (Standard Edition)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)) [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)) in case you only need the runtime.

# Java Platform
- [What Can Java Technology Do?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/intro/cando.html`)

Every full implementation of the Java platform gives you the following features:

## Development Tools
- :+1: See also [Tools](#Tools).

The development tools provide everything you'll need for compiling, running, monitoring, debugging, and documenting your applications. As a new developer, the main tools you'll be using are the javac compiler, the java launcher, and the javadoc documentation tool.

## Application Programming Interface (API)
The API provides the core functionality of the [Java programming language](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Language). It offers a wide array of useful classes ready for use in your own applications. It spans everything from basic objects, to networking and security, to [XML](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language/XML-\(eXtensible-Markup-Language\)) generation and [database](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database) access, and more. The core API is very large; to get an overview of what it contains, consult the [Java Platform Standard Edition](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)) 8 documentation.

## Deployment Technologies
- :+1: See also [Tools](#Tools).

The [JDK software](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JDK-\(Java-Development-Kit\)) provides standard mechanisms such as the Java Web Start software and Java Plug-In software for deploying your applications to end users.

## User Interface Toolkits
- :+1: See also [Tools](#Tools).

The [JavaFX](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/JavaFX), [Swing](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JFC-\(Java-Foundation-Classes\)/Swing), and [Java 2D](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JFC-\(Java-Foundation-Classes\)/Java-2D) toolkits make it possible to create sophisticated [Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/UX-\(User-Experience\)/GUI-\(Graphical-User-Interface\)).

## Integration Libraries
- :+1: See also [Tools](#Tools).

Integration libraries such as the [Java IDL API](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/Java-IDL-\(Java-Interface-Definition-Language\)), [JDBC API](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JDBC-\(Java-Database-Connectivity\)), [Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/JNDI-\(Java-Naming-and-Directory-Interface\)), [Java RMI](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/RMI-\(Remote-Method-Invocation\)), and [Java Remote Method Invocation over Internet Inter-ORB Protocol Technology (Java RMI-IIOP Technology)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)/RMI%2DIIOP-\(RMI-over-IIOP\)) enable [database](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Database) access and manipulation of remote objects.

# Tips and Tricks

## Code Conventions

### Naming Conventions
1. [Oracle: Java Naming Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html)

## Floating-Point Arithmetic
<span data-comment="Preserve old link name." id="currency-and-decimals---problems-with-float-%26-double"></span>
- [Floating Point Arithmetic](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Floating%2DPoint-Arithmetic).

## Getting Started
Few operating systems now come with Java pre-installed. Consequently, you'll likely have to install it. The download link is found in the **[Reference](#Reference)** section above. Here we are only covering [Windows](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Microsoft-Windows). Steps may vary for other operating systems.

### Windows 10 (08/2021)

#### Java Development Kit (JDK) with JRE
- :+1: See also [JDK (Java Development Kit)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JDK-\(Java-Development-Kit\)).
- [How To Install OpenJDK 16 On Windows](https://java.tutorials24x7.com/blog/how-to-install-openjdk-16-on-windows).

1. Do you already have a [JRE](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\))?
   - Open a [command prompt](/Tech-Ref/CLI-\(Command-Line-Interface\)) and enter `java -version`.
   - If some version is listed you'll need to decide what to do with it. [I (SWelker)](/Individuals/Scott-Welker) opted to uninstall it, in preference of the on my chosen [JDK (Java Development Kit)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JDK-\(Java-Development-Kit\)) provides. 
1. Download [OpenJDK](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/OpenJDK-\(Open-Java-Development-Kit\)) Zip file (`openjdk-16.0.2_windows-x64_bin.zip`).
1. Extract [Zip file](/Tech-Ref/Zip) to `C:\Java\OpenJDK\jdk-16`.
1. Add the `bin` folder to your system's path `C:\Java\OpenJDK\jdk-16.0.2\bin`.
1. Add or update `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Ensure it points to your new `C:\Java\OpenJDK\jdk-16.0.2' (omit the `bin` folder).
1. Close and reopen a [command prompt](/Tech-Ref/CLI-\(Command-Line-Interface\)).
   - Open a [command prompt](/Tech-Ref/CLI-\(Command-Line-Interface\)) and enter `java -version`.
   - You should get the version installed with your [JDK](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/OpenJDK-\(Open-Java-Development-Kit\)).
1. Done. The link provided at the beginning of this section goes further, creating, compiling and executing a simply `Hello world!` program. You may want to do this too.

#### Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - Alone
- :+1: See also [JRE (Java Runtime Environment)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)).
- :+1: Not likely needed if you've previously installed a [JDK (Java Development Kit)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JDK-\(Java-Development-Kit\)).

1. Download and install the [JRE (Java Runtime Environment)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/JRE-\(Java-Runtime-Environment\)), using the [Java SE (Standard Edition)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Java-SE-\(Standard-Edition\)), `jre-8u301-windows-x64.exe` as of this writing.
   - Verify the install by opening a [command prompt](/Tech-Ref/CLI-\(Command-Line-Interface\)) and entering `java -version`. You should see something like this:

## Java and C# Data Type Equivalents
- [IBM: Java and C# data type equivalents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wxs/8.6.0?topic=applications-java-data-type-equivalents)

## java.exe, javaw.exe, and javaws.exe?
- [StackOverflow: What is the difference between 'java', 'javaw', and 'javaws'?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8194713/what-is-the-difference-between-java-javaw-and-javaws/8194750#8194750)
   - > The java tool launches a Java application. It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading a specified class, and invoking that class's main method.
   - > The javaw command is identical to java, except that with javaw there is no associated console window. Use javaw when you don't want a command prompt window to appear.
   - > javaws command, the "Java Web Start command" launches Java Web Start, which is the reference implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP). Java Web Start launches Java applications/applets hosted on a network.
      - > If a JNLP file is specified, javaws will launch the Java application/applet specified in the JNLP file.
      - > The javaws launcher has a set of options that are supported in the current release. However, the options may be removed in a future release.
