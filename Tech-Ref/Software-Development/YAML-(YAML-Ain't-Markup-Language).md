# Introduction
"_***YAML*** (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't [Markup Language](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language)") is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as [Extensible Markup Language (XML)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language/XML-\(eXtensible-Markup-Language\)) but has a minimal syntax... It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses `[...]` for lists and `{...}` for maps so that [JSON](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JSON-\(JavaScript-Object-Notation\)) files are valid YAML 1.2._"
