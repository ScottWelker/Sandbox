# Introduction
"_***Integration testing*** is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. It occurs after [unit testing](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/QE-\(Quality-Engineering\)/Unit-Testing) and before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing_"

- :+1: Increasingly ***Integration Testing*** refers to automated tests created by developers that are integrated into a [CD (Continuous Delivery)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/CI-CD-\(Continuous-Integration-%2D-Continuous-Delivery\)/CD-\(Continuous-Delivery\)) solution, e.g. [Azure DevOps](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Microsoft-Azure/ADO-\(Azure-DevOps\)), [GitLab](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/GitLab), [Apache Maven](/Tech-Ref/Apache-Software-Foundation/Apache-Maven), [Gradle](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/DevOps-\(Development-and-IT-Operations\)/Gradle), or the like.
