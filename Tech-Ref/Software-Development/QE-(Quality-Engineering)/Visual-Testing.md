# Introduction
"_***Visual Testing,*** sometimes called **visual UI testing**, or **visual diff testing**, verifies that the software user interface (UI) appears correctly to all users. Essentially, visual tests check that each element on a web page appears in the right shape, size, and position. It also checks that these elements appear and function perfectly on a variety of devices and browsers. In other words, visual testing factors in how multiple environments, screen sizes, OSes, and other variables will affect what software looks like._"
