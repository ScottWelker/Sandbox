# Introduction
"_***Test-driven development (TDD)*** is a [software development](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development) process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all [software development](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development) by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later._"
