# Introduction
"_***Component testing*** is a sub-category of software testing in which each individual component of the software is separately tested without integrating with other components. It is also known as module testing, when viewed from an architecture perspective._"

"_Software, in general, is made up of several components. Component testing addresses these components individually. It is one of the most frequent type of black box testing. It is generally performed by the QA (Quality Assurance) team._"
