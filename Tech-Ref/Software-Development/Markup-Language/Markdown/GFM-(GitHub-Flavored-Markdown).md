# Introduction
***GitHub Flavored markdown*** is a strict [CommonMark](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language/Markdown/CommonMark) superset, adding support for additional formatting such as _tables_ and _nesting block content inside list elements_, as well as GitHub-specific features such as _auto-linking references_ to commits, _issues_, _usernames_, **etc.**

# Tips and Tricks

## Space MUST follow Heading's Hash Symbol (#)
- "_[GFM requires that the hash symbol that creates a heading be separated from the heading text by a space character.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#GitHub_Flavored_Markdown)_"
   - E.g., see [Import Slalom Knowledge, Heading Syntax Differs](/Clients/CAI-\(Cox-Automotive-Inc\)/Infrastructure-\(CAI\)/Systems-and-Services-\(CAI\)/GitHub-\(CAI\)/GHE%2Dbased-Knowledge-Store-\(CAI\)/Import-Slalom-Knowledge-\(CAI-GHE%2Dbased-Knowledge-Store\)#heading-syntax-differs).
