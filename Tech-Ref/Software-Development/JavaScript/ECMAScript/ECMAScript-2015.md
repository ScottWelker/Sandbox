# Introduction
"_***ECMAScript 2015,*** formerly [ECMAScript version 6 (ES6)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/ECMAScript/ECMAScript-2015/ES6-\(ECMAScript-version-6\)), refers to version 6 of the [ECMA Script (Javascript) programming language](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript)._"

# New Features (significant)
This isn't meant to be comprehensive. Just a quick note of the more useful, notable additions.

## Constants
- Constants are values that can be defined only once (per scope, scope explained below).

## Block-Scoped Variables and Functions
- With ES2015, variables declared using let (and constants describe above) follow block scoping rules just like in Java, C++, etc.

## Arrow Functions (Lambda/Anonymous)
An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.

- _Arrow functions_ are a new way to write [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) function expressions. See also:
   - [Anonymous Function (Lambda)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Anonymous-Function).
   - [Arrow function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

## Default Function Parameters
- Function parameters can now be declared with default values.

## Arbitrary Function Arguments ('Rest Function Parameters')
- The "_rest function parameters_" syntax facilitates invoking a function and passing an arbitrary number of arguments.

## String Templating (Interpolation)
- String templating refers to interpolating variables and expressions into strings using a syntax like perl or the shell. A string template is enclosed in back-tick characters (`). By contrast single quotes (') or double quotes (") indicate normal strings. Expressions inside the template are marked out between ${ and }.

## Formal Class Definition Syntax
- JavaScript gets a formal class definition syntax. While it is merely syntactic sugar over the already available protytype-based classes, it does serve to enhance code clarity. That means this does not add a new object model or anything fancy like that.
