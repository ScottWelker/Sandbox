# Introduction
***Babel*** is a free and open-source [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) transcompiler that is mainly used to convert [ECMAScript 2015+ (ES6+)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) code into a backwards compatible version of [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) that can be run by older [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) engines. Babel is a popular tool for using the newest features of the JavaScript programming language.

Developers can use new [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) language features by using Babel to convert their source code into versions of [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) that evolving browsers are able to process.
