# Introduction

"_***React Native*** is a [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for **iOS** and **Android**. It’s based on [React](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/React), Facebook’s [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the [browser](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Browser), it targets mobile platforms. In other words: web developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly "native," all from the comfort of a [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) library that we already know and love. Plus, because most of the code you write can be shared between platforms, React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS._"

"_Similar to [React](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/React) for the [Web](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)), React Native applications are written using a mixture of [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) and [XML-esque](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language/XML-\(eXtensible-Markup-Language\)) markup, known as [JSX](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/JSX-\(JavaScript-XML\)). Then, under the hood, the React Native “bridge” invokes the native rendering APIs in Objective-C (for iOS) or [Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java) (for Android). Thus, your application will render using real mobile UI components, not webviews, and will look and feel like any other mobile application. React Native also exposes [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) interfaces for platform APIs, so your React Native apps can access platform features like the phone camera, or the user’s location._"
