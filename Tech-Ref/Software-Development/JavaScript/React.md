# Introduction
"_***React*** is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of [single-page](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Application/SPA-\(Single-Page-Application\)) or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [DOM](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/DOM-\(Document-Object-Model\)), so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing. [React Router](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/React/React-Router) is an example of such a library. And also large and complicated applications are required to make [AJAX](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/AJAX-\(Asynchronous-JavaScript-and-XML\)) calls to fetch or change data. You can use any library you like with React such as Axios, [JQuery](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/jQuery) [AJAX](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/AJAX-\(Asynchronous-JavaScript-and-XML\)) or the [browser](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Browser) built-in `window.fetch`_."

## Notes
1. :bulb: It is not required to only build [Single Page Applications (SPAs)](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Application/SPA-\(Single-Page-Application\)) with react but that is it's most common usage.
1. [React](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/React) components are typically written using [JSX](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/JSX-\(JavaScript-XML\)), although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript)).
1. [npm](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/npm), the [Node.js](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js) package manager, is a popular tool for establishing the React development environment.
   - Consider installing [Node.js](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js) for the [npm package manager](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/npm). Then you can use `npm install -g create-react-app`. See [Establish the React Dev Environment](#establish-the-react-dev-environment) below.
