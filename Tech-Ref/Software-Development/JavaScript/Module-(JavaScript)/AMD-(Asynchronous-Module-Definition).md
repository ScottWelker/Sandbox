# Introduction
"_***Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)*** is a [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) specification that defines an [application programming interface (API)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/API-\(Application-Programming-Interface\)) that defines [code modules](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Module-\(JavaScript\)) and their dependencies, and loads them asynchronously, if desired. Implementations of AMD provide the following benefits:_"
   - "_Website performance improvements. AMD implementations load smaller [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) files, and then only when they are needed._"
   - "_Fewer page errors. AMD implementations allow developers to define dependencies that must load before a module is executed, so the module does not try to use outside code that is not available yet._"

"_In addition to loading multiple [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) files at runtime, AMD implementations allow developers to encapsulate code in smaller, more logically-organized files, in a way similar to other programming languages such as Java. For production and deployment, developers can concatenate and minify [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) modules based on an AMD API into one file, the same as traditional [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript)._"

"_AMD provides some [CommonJS](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Module-\(JavaScript\)/CJS-\(CommonJS\)) interoperability. It allows for using a similar `exports` and `require()` interface in the code, although its own `define()` interface is more basal and preferred._"

"_The AMD specification is implemented by Dojo Toolkit, RequireJS, and other libraries._"
