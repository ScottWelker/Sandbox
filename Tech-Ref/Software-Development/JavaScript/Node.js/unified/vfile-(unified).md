# Introduction
***vfile*** is a [unified](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified) virtual file format that tracks metadata (such as a fileâ€™s path and value) and [messages](https://github.com/vfile/vfile#vfilemessages).

Small and browser friendly, _vfile_ was made specifically for [unified](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified) and generally for the common task of parsing, transforming, and serializing data, where _vfile_ handles everything about the document being compiled.
