# Introduction
"_The ***package-lock.json*** file, introduced with [npm version 5](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/npm), provides for "_deterministic installs_", i.e. ensuring exact versions of every package are installed. This ensures that a product is 100% reproducible in the same way even if packages are updated by their maintainers._"
