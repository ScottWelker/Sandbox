# Introduction
"_***unified***, sometimes the '_unified collective_', is a friendly interface backed by an ecosystem of plugins built for creating and manipulating content. You donâ€™t have to worry about parsing as you have the primitives to build on._"

"_We compile content to syntax trees and syntax trees to content. We also provide hundreds of packages to work on the trees in between. You can build on the unified collective to make all kinds of interesting things._"

# Usage
- https://github.com/unifiedjs/handbook#usage

With unified you don't handle syntax or parsing yourself. Instead you select your [processor(s)](#unified-collective-(ecosystems/processors)) and chain them together, with or without [plugin(s)](#unified-plugins) that you select or develop, and then initiate the "_unified process_" to accomplish your goals.

## Code Narration
Top-level numbers here correspond to the [Code Example's](#code-narration) circled numbers, 1..4 above. This code illustrates just one example use-case. Many, many others are possible. Briefly:
1. Load required [modules](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Module-\(JavaScript\)), `require(...)`. Seven different ones in this use-case:
   1. [unified](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified).
   1. [remark-parse](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/remark/remark%2Dparse).
   1. [remark-rehype](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/remark/remark%2Drehype).
   1. [rehype-document](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/rehype/rehype%2Ddocument).
   1. [rehype-format](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/rehype/rehype%2Dformat).
   1. [rehype-stringify](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/rehype/rehype%2Dstringify).
   1. [vfile-reporter (unified)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/vfile%2Dreporter).
1. Instantiate (construct) the unified [processor](#unified-collective-(ecosystems/processors)), `unified()`.
1. Chain the plugins together, `.use(...)`. Five in this use-case:
   1. [markdown (remark-parse)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/remark/remark%2Dparse).
   1. [remark2rehype (remark-rehype)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/remark/remark%2Drehype).
   1. [doc (rehype-document)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/rehype/rehype%2Ddocument).
   1. [format (rehype-format)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/rehype/rehype%2Dformat).
   1. [html (rehype-stringify)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/rehype/rehype%2Dstringify).
1. Kickoff the _unified_ process, `.process(...)`, passing your input and a function to handle and "_report_" the processing status.
   + "_Reporting_" leverages the [vfile-reporter](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/vfile%2Dreporter) plugin.

# Processors (Parsers, Compilers, and Transpilers)
Typical use-cases generally require both a "_parser_" and a "_compiler_", which most "_[Processors](#unified-collective-(ecosystems/processors))_" provide. Although, strictly speaking, you might not need to use both a parser and a compiler.

The unified "_[Processor](#unified-collective-(ecosystems/processors))_" allows [plugins](#unified-plugins) to be chained together to transform content. The chain of [plugins](#unified-plugins) defines how your content flows through the [processor](#unified-collective-(ecosystems/processors)).

## Parsers
A parser takes a string and tokenizes it based on syntax. A [markdown parser](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language/Markdown/Markdown-Parser) would turn `# Hello, world!` into a **heading** node.

## Compilers
A compiler turns an [UST/AST](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/UST-\(Universal-Syntax-Tree\)) into its "output". This is typically a string. Again, most "_[Processors](#unified-collective-(ecosystems/processors))_" provide both a _Parser_ and a _Compiler_.

## Transpilers
Transpilers convert one [UST/AST](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/UST-\(Universal-Syntax-Tree\)) syntax tree into to another.

# Unified 'Utilities'
"_unified Utilities_" are simply functions that operate on nodes. 

## Syntax Tree Specific Utilities
There are several projects that deal with nodes from specifications implementing [unist](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified/UST-\(Universal-Syntax-Tree\)):
   - [hast utilities](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast#list-of-utilities)
   - [mdast utilities](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#list-of-utilities)
   - [nlcst utilities](https://github.com/syntax-tree/nlcst#list-of-utilities)
   - [xast utilities](https://github.com/syntax-tree/xast#list-of-utilities)

# Unified Plugins

## Basic Structure
- [Transforming Markdown with Remark & Rehype](https://www.ryanfiller.com/blog/remark-and-rehype-plugins).

Your custom plugin works via a [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) function that you create which returns a `transformer` method. That transformer method is run on each `node` found by the `unist-util-visit` packageâ€™s `visit` method. The plugin will be called by the `unified` process and will be passed the [AST tree](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Data-Structures/AST-\(Abstract-Syntax-Tree\)). There are many ways to directly mutate the tree.

# Tips and Tricks

## ANSI Colors (VS Code)
Elements of the [unified ecosystem](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js/unified) may emit [ANSI Escape Codes](/Tech-Ref/ANSI-Escape-Codes) that aren't handled/displayed well in certain contexts. [VS Code (Visual Studio Code)](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Visual-Studio/VS-Code-\(Visual-Studio-Code\)), with the [ANSI Colors extension](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Visual-Studio/VS-Code-\(Visual-Studio-Code\)/ANSI-Colors-\(VS-Code\)) may be of use.
