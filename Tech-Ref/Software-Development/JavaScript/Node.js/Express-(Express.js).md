# Introduction
"_***Express***, sometimes **Express.js**, is a back end web application framework for [Node.js](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js), released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for [Node.js](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/Node.js)._"

"_It's a [Sinatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software))-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the back-end component of popular development stacks like the [MEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)), MERN or MEVN stack, together with the [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) database software and a [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) front-end framework or library._"
