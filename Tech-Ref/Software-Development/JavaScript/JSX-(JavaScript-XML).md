# Introduction
***JavaScript XML (JSX)*** an [XML](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Markup-Language/XML-\(eXtensible-Markup-Language\))-like syntax extension to [JavaScript (ECMAScript)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) without any defined semantics. It's NOT intended to be implemented by engines or browsers. It's NOT a proposal to incorporate JSX into the [JavaScript (ECMAScript)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript) specification itself. It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard [JavaScript (ECMAScript)](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript).

:+1: Tips!
   - [React](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/React) components are typically written using [JSX](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript/JSX-\(JavaScript-XML\)), although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure [JavaScript](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/JavaScript)).
   - Code written in JSX requires conversion with a tool such as Babel before it can be understood by web browsers.
