# Introduction
***Algorithmic Complexity*** or "_Time Complexity_" refers to formal measures of how fast a program or algorithm runs.
- Algorithms are programs that perform just a computation, not other things computers often do such as networking tasks or user input and output. Complexity analysis allows us to measure how fast a program is when it performs the computations.
- Operations that are purely computational include numerical floating-point operations such as addition and multiplication; searching within a database that fits in RAM for a given value; determining the path an artificial-intelligence character will walk through in a video game so that they only have to walk a short distance within their virtual world; or running a regular expression pattern match on a string. Computation is ubiquitous in computer programs.
- Complexity analysis is also a tool that allows us to explain how an algorithm behaves as the input grows larger.
- Time complexity is commonly expressed using [big O](#big-O) notation.

## Big O
Big(O) notation is an algorithm complexity metric. It defines the relationship between the number of inputs and the steps taken by the algorithm to process those inputs. Big O time complexity is typically expressed as follows, ![image.png](/.attachments/image-46254b49-48ea-4f4a-875b-ac2acb289128.png =170x25), etc., where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input.
