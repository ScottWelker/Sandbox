# Introduction
This page identifies several programming naming [conventions](#conventions) for naming things using more than one word, AKA ***Programming 'Case' Types***.

Otherwise, all letters are lowercase. | Lower Camel Case| Generally used for variable naming.<br/><br/>[PascalCase](#pascalcase) is a variation.|
| COBOL-CASE<span id="cobolcase"/> | All caps with words separated by — (hyphen) | <ul><li>Screaming Kebab Case</li><li>Train Case (note [Train-Case](#traincase) variation.</li></ul> | |
| flatcase<span id="flatcase"/> | | <ul><li>Mumble Case</li><li>Lazy Case</li></ul> | Generally used for [Java package](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Language/Package-\(Java\)) names. |

| MACRO_CASE <span id="macrocase"/> | Macro case is naming with all letters Capitalized but the words are joined with _ (underscore). | Upper Case :mask: | Generally used for preprocessor directives and constants. |
| PascalCase <span id="pascalcase"/> | Pascal Case is naming with First letter of each word is Capitalized. | <ul><li>Capital Camel Case</li><li>Upper Camel Case</li></ul> | Generally, used for class Naming. |
