# Introduction
"_***Black*** is the uncompromising [Python](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Python) code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters._

_'Blackened code' looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead._

_Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible._"
