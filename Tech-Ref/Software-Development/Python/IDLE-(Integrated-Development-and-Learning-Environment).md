# Introduction
"_***IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)*** is an [integrated development environment](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/IDE-\(Integrated-Development-Environment\)) for [Python](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Python), which has been bundled with the default implementation of the language since 1.5.2b1. It is packaged as an optional part of the [Python](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Python) packaging with many [Linux](/Tech-Ref/Linux) distributions. It is completely written in [Python](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Python) and the Tkinter GUI toolkit (wrapper functions for Tcl/Tk)._"

"_IDLE is intended to be a simple IDE and suitable for beginners, especially in an educational environment. To that end, it is cross-platform, and avoids feature clutter._"
