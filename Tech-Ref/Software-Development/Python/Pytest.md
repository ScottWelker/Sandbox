# Introduction
"_***Pytest*** is a software testing framework based on the [Python programming language](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Python). It can be used to write various types of software tests, including [unit tests](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/QE-\(Quality-Engineering\)/Unit-Testing), [integration tests](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/QE-\(Quality-Engineering\)/Integration-Testing), end-to-end tests, and functional tests. Pytest is known for its scalability and concision as well as its rich features such as parametrized testing, fixtures, assert re-writing, and test filtering._"

"_Pytest was developed as part of an effort by third-party packages to address [Python's](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Python) built-in module unittest's shortcommings, and is considered by some to be one of the most popular and effective testing frameworks in [Python](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Python). Some well-known cases of projects switching to Pytest from unittest and nose include those of Mozilla and Dropbox._"
