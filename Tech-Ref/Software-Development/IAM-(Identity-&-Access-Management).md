# Introduction
***Identity & Access Management (IAM)*** "_is a framework of policies and technologies to ensure that the right users (that are part of the ecosystem connected to or within an enterprise) have the appropriate access to technology resources._"

Another source states "_Identity & Access Management is the discipline of managing the life cycle of digital accounts that correspond to and are under the control of a person and ensuring that only the correct resources are accessed by the correct actor under the correct context._" -- [Implementing Identity Management on AWS](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-identity-management/9781800562288/B16838_01_Epub_AM.xhtml#:-:text=''Identity%20%26%20Access%20Management%20is,under%20the%20correct%20context.'')

## Concepts and Terms
These are brief, high-level definitions. They are not comprehensive. 

### Identity Management
- Identity management is responsible for:
   1. Keeping accounts up to date.
   1. Keeping downstream consumers of those accounts synchronized with the authoritative sources that define the account.
   1. Provisioning and deprovisioning accounts entirely from various data stores.

### Access Management
- Access management addresses the authentication of the account (proving you are who you say you are) and the authorization of that account (proving that you are allowed to do what you are trying to do with that account) to access resources or to perform certain tasks in accordance with established policies.

#### Roles and Policies (Separation of Duties)
- Separation of duties requires more than one person in order to complete a business task. Organizations implement separation of duties by applying technical controls that restrict or enable what a person can do based on business and regulatory requirements. Those rules, restrictions, and permissions are called **policies**, and a collection of policies that grants somebody the full range of access that they are entitled to depending upon their responsibilities is called a **role**.
