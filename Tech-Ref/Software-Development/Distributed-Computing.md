# Introduction
"_***Distributed Computing*** is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different [networked computers (hosts)](/Tech-Ref/Networking/Host), which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from [SOA](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Distributed-Computing/SOA-\(Service-Oriented-Architecture\))-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications._"

"_A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs). There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure [HTTP](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/HTTP-\(Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol\)), RPC-like connectors and message queues_"
