# Introduction
"_**Feature Flags** (sometimes refered to as Feature Toggles) are a powerful technique, allowing teams to modify system behavior without changing code. They fall into various usage categories, and it's important to take that categorization into account when implementing and managing toggles. <mark>Toggles introduce complexity</mark>. We can keep that complexity in check by using smart toggle implementation practices and appropriate tools to manage our toggle configuration, but <mark>we should also aim to constrain the number of toggles in our system</mark>._"
