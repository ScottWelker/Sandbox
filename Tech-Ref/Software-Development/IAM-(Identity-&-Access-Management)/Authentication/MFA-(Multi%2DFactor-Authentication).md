# Introduction
***Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*** (encompassing two-factor authentication, or 2FA, along with similar terms) is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a [website](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Site) or [application](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Application) only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user has), and inherence (something only the user is). MFA protects user data—which may include personal identification or financial assets—from being accessed by an unauthorized third party that may have been able to discover, for example, a single password._"
