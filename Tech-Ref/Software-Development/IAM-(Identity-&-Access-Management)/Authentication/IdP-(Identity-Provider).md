# Introduction
***Identity Provider (IdP)*** is a service that stores and manages digital identities. Companies use these services to allow their employees or users to connect with the resources they need. They provide a way to manage access, adding or removing privileges, while security remains tight._"

"_If you've ever used your Google or Facebook login to access an app, you've used an IdP. Your username and password open doors to another resource, and you don't have to do anything special to make it happen._"
