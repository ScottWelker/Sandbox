# Introduction
"_The ***IBM AS/400*** is a family of midrange computers from IBM announced in June 1988. It was the intended successor to the System/36 and System/38 platforms, and ran the OS/400 operating system. Lower-cost but more powerful than its predecessors, the AS/400 series was extremely successful at launch... Installs reached a peak of about 250,000 systems by 1994, by which time [Unix-based](/Tech-Ref/Unix) systems had begun encroaching on the market._"
