# Introduction
"_Stack Exchange is a network of question-and-answer (Q&A) websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process. The reputation system allows the sites to be self-moderating. As of August 2019, the three most actively-viewed sites in the network are [Stack Overflow](/Tech-Ref/Stack-Exchange/Stack-Overflow), **Super User**, and **Ask Ubuntu**._"
