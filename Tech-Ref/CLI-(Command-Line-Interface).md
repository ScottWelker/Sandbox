# Introduction
"_***Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)*** processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS, [Unix](/Tech-Ref/Unix) systems and personal computer systems including DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS._"

"_Today, many users rely upon [graphical user interfaces](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/UX-\(User-Experience\)/GUI-\(Graphical-User-Interface\)) and menu-driven interactions. However, some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a [graphical user interface](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/UX-\(User-Experience\)/GUI-\(Graphical-User-Interface\)) and may still use a command line._"

"_<mark>Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting.</mark>_"
