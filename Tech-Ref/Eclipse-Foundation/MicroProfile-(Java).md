# Introduction
"_The [Eclipse Foundation](/Tech-Ref/Eclipse-Foundation) ***MicroProfile*** is a baseline platform definition that optimizes [Enterprise Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)) for a [microservices architecture](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Distributed-Computing/Microservices) and delivers application portability across multiple MicroProfile runtimes._"

"_Developers have a tremendous amount of [Java EE](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)) and general [Enterprise Java](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Java/Java-Platform-Editions/Jakarta-EE-\(Enterprise-Edition\)) knowledge and skill that they want to leverage as they evaluate the adoption of a [cloud-native architecture](/Tech-Ref/Software-Development/Cloud-Computing/Cloud-Native-Computing)._"
