# Introduction
In graphic design and advertising, a ***comprehensive layout*** or ***comprehensive***, usually shortened to ***comp***, is the page layout of a proposed design as initially presented by the designer to a client, showing the relative positions of text and illustrations before the final content of those elements has been decided upon. The comp thus serves as a draft of the final layout, and (if approved) is used as guide for further design changes and, ultimately, production.
