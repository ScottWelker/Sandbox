# Introduction
"_***SharePoint*** is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations._"

SharePoint is available in self-hosted (on-premises) or cloud-based (online):
