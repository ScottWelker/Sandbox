# Introduction
"_***Microsoft Sentinel*** is a cloud native [SIEM](/Tech-Ref/Cybersecurity/SIEM-\(Security-Information-and-Event-Management\)) that aggregates data from multiple sources, including users, applications, servers, and devices running on-premises or in any cloud. Allowing for the analysis of millions of records, Sentinel uses artificial intelligence to scrutinize threat data. An increasingly high number of supported data source connectors enable rapid onboarding of many security solutions, as well as provide for open standards such as CEF and Syslog. Together with Azure Log Analytics, Sentinel allows rapid connection to collect data from a wide spectrum of data sources, pre-built functionality, visibility to multi-cloud and hybrid environments, and powerful intelligent security analytics._"
