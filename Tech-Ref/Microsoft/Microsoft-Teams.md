# Introduction
"_**Microsoft Teams** is a proprietary business communication platform developed by Microsoft, as part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams primarily competes with the similar service Slack, offering workspace chat and videoconferencing, file storage, and application integration. Teams is replacing other Microsoft-operated business messaging and collaboration platforms, including Skype for Business and Microsoft Classroom. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Teams has gained much interest as many meetings have moved to a virtual environment._"

# Tips and Tricks

## File Storage in Teams
- [Microsoft: File storage in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/file-storage-in-teams-df5cc0a5-d1bb-414c-8870-46c6eb76686a):
   - Files that you upload to a channel are stored in your team's [SharePoint](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/SharePoint) folder. These files are available in the Files tab at the top of each channel.
   - Files that you upload to a one-on-one or group chat are stored in your OneDrive for Business folder and are shared only with the people in that conversation. These are available in the Files tab at the top of a chat.

## Guests in Teams

## How to Find Things in Teams
- [How to Find Things in Microsoft Teams](https://www.crestwood.com/2020/05/18/how-to-find-things-in-microsoft-teams/)

### Basic Search Menu Bar
- With the basic menu bar search tool at the top, typing in a keyword will automatically display Teams and Channels that contain documents or conversations with the Keyword. 
   - ![image.png](/.attachments/image-050a15f5-6be9-4d51-9d0c-e5a51cbda076.png)
- Once you type in your keyword you can select a location in the drop-down list. Clicking on a Team or Channel in the drop-down menu will take you to that specific area and display all conversations or files related to your Keyword (if any).
- If you can’t find what you are looking for in the drop-down menu, clicking Enter after your keyword has been typed will display all documents and conversations in relation to that keyword on the left. Here you will have the option to dig deeper in your search using filters: Messages, People, and Files; then by who it’s from; then the file type, whether a document (DOCX, PDF, XLSX) or chat. With the More Filters feature you can specify dates, Team, Channel, mentions, and more.

### Search by Files Tab
- Another way to search for files is by clicking on the Files icon on your left menu ribbon. When you click on the Files icon, the left-hand column will now display: Recent, Microsoft Teams, Downloads, and Cloud Storage (your OneDrive).

### Refining results with operators
- Sometimes the basic searches bring up too many options.  If you need to narrow the results of your search, Microsoft Teams allows you to search by operators. Below are some examples.
- :warning: Note: 
   1. Search **operators do not work searching for people**. 
   1. **Some of the operators work with messages but not all**. 
   1. **If a document/file contains the keyword those files will appear in the results**.

#### Exact (" ")
- Search by “ “ to obtain an exact result.

#### OR
- Search by using OR, e.g. X OR Y. Search for more than one word if you aren’t certain what you are looking for.

#### AND
- Search by using AND – X AND Y, narrows your search if you know what you are looking for.

#### Exclude Term (-)
- Search with a dash symbol (–) – This will exclude a term or word.

#### File Type
- Search by file type [docx](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft-Word), [xlsx](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Microsoft-Excel), [PDF](/Tech-Ref/PDF-\(Portable-Document-Format\)), etc. to obtain results that contain a certain file type.

#### Wildcard (*)
- Add * – a wildcard will search for a word that contains what you’ve searched for, e.g. train* gives training as a result as well.
