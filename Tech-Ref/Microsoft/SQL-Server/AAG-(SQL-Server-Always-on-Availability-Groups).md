# Introduction
[SQL Server](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/SQL-Server) "_***Always on Availability Groups*** feature is a high-availability and disaster-recovery solution that provides an enterprise-level alternative to database mirroring. Introduced in [SQL Server](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/SQL-Server) 2012 (11.x), Always On availability groups maximizes the availability of a set of user databases for an enterprise. An availability group supports a failover environment for a discrete set of user databases, known as availability databases, that fail over together. An availability group supports a set of read-write primary databases and one to eight sets of corresponding secondary databases. Optionally, secondary databases can be made available for read-only access and/or some backup operations._"

"_An availability group fails over at the level of an availability replica. Failovers are not caused by database issues such as a database becoming suspect due to a loss of a data file, deletion of a database, or corruption of a transaction log._"
