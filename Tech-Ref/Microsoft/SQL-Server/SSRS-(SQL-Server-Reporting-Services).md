# Introduction
"_***SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)*** is a server-based report generating software system from Microsoft. It is part of a suite of Microsoft SQL Server services, including [SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services)](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/SQL-Server/SSAS-\(SQL-Server-Analysis-Services\)) and [SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/SQL-Server/SSIS-\(SQL-Server-Integration-Services\))._"

"_Administered via a [Web interface](/Tech-Ref/WWW-\(World-Wide-Web\)/Web-Application), it can be used to prepare and deliver a variety of interactive and printed reports. The SSRS service provides an interface into Microsoft [Visual Studio](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/Visual-Studio) so that developers as well as SQL administrators can connect to [SQL databases](/Tech-Ref/Microsoft/SQL-Server) and use SSRS tools to format SQL reports in many complex ways. It also provides a 'Report Builder' tool for less technical users to format SQL reports of lesser complexity._"

"_SSRS competes with [Crystal Reports](/Tech-Ref/Crystal-Reports) and other business intelligence tools._"
